# YamlValidations

Convert this:

    books:
      required:
        authors:
          schema: author

        author:
          required:
            id: str?
            name: str?
            org_id: int?
          optional:
            address: str?

To `dry-validation`

    BooksSchema = Dry::Validation.Schema do
      required(:authors).schema(AuthorSchema)
      optional(:address).maybe(:str?)
    end

    Books::AuthorSchema = Dry::Validation.Schema do
      required(:id).filled(:str?)
      required(:name).filled(:str?)
      required(:org_id).filled(:int?)
      optional(:address).maybe(:str?)
    end

Via:

    yaml_validations generate dry-validation books.yaml

Other validation formats will be configured later.
